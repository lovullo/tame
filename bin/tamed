Usage: $0 [--kill] [runpath]
Start tamed and runners.  Do not fork into background process.

The default value of RUNPATH is \`/run/user/$UID/tamed'.

Only one runner is currently supported.  tamed exits once all
runners have terminated.  Runners will be killed once they are
inactive for at least TAMED_STALL_SECONDS (default 30).

Options:
  --help   show this message
  --kill   kill a runing tamed at path RUNPATH

Environment Variables:
  TAMED_STALL_SECONDS   number of seconds of runner inactivity before
                        runner is automatically killed (default 30)
