    Explicit symbol reservations

    Any symbol mentioned within this file will be disallowed from being used in
    any @sym attribute within raters/packages.

    Note that this list need not contain symbols defined elsewhere in the
    framework. For example, symbols mentioned in symbol-map need not appear here.

    Do not be overly picky with this list; include only those that are established
    in the field of mathematics as a whole (not a specific category, unless it is
    CS), where the symbol is almost always understood to have a particular
    meaning. For example:

      - We wouldn't want to allow \pi, since that is already established as the
        ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter
      - Nor should we allow \delta, since that is commonly used in CS to represent
        Kronecker's delta
      - We should *not*, however, disallow \mu just because it is the MÃ¶bius
        function in number theory

  <reserved>
    <!-- commonly used as an alterative to Iverson's convention under certain
         circumstances, so it's best to avoid the notation entirely even if it is
         not used within the framework -->
    <reserve sym="\delta" reason="Kronecker delta" />

    <reserve sym="\pi" reason="Ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter" />
    <reserve sym="\phi" reason="The golden ratio (another established mathematical constant)" />
    <reserve sym="\Sigma" reason="Summation symbol; sigma-notation" />
    <reserve sym="\Pi" reasons="Product symbol; pi-notation" />

    <!-- as common as this is in programming as an index, this is another
         established mathematical constant (sqrt(-1)) -->
    <reserve sym="i" reason="Imaginary number" />
  </reserved>
