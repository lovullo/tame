//! An IR that is "near" the source code.
//!
//! This IR is "near" the source code written by the user,
//!   performing only basic normalization tasks like desugaring.
//! It takes a verbose input language and translates it into a much more
//!   concise internal representation.
//! The hope is that most desugaring will be done by templates in the future.
//!
//! NIR cannot completely normalize the source input because it does not
//!   have enough information to do so---the
//!     template system requires a compile-time interpreter that is beyond
//!     the capabilities of NIR,
//!       and so a final normalization pass must be done later on in the
//!       lowering pipeline.
//!
//! This is a streaming IR,
//!   meaning that the equivalent AST is not explicitly represented as a
//!   tree structure in memory.
//!
//! NIR is lossy and does not retain enough information for code
//!   formatting---that
//!     type of operation will require a mapping between
//!     XIRF and NIR,
//!       where the latter is used to gather enough context for formatting
//!       and the former is used as a concrete representation of what the user
//!       actually typed.
//!
//! For more information on the parser,
//!   see [`parse`].
//! The entry point for NIR in the lowering pipeline is exported as
//!   [`XirfToNir`].
