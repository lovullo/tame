//! Intermediate representation for construction of the

//! AIR serves as an abstraction layer between higher-level parsers and the

//! It allows parsers to operate as a raw stream of data without having to
//!   worry about ownership of or references to the ASG,
//!     and allows for multiple such parsers to be joined.
