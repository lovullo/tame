//! Objects represented by the ASG.
//!
//! Dynamic Object Types and Narrowing
//! ==================================
//! Unlike the functional lowering pipeline that precedes it,
//!   the ASG is a mutable, ever-evolving graph of dynamic data.
//! The ASG does not benefit from the same type-level guarantees that the
//!   rest of the system does at compile-time.
//!
//! Any node on the graph can represent any type of [`Object`].
//! An [`ObjectIndex`] contains an index into the graph,
//!   _not_ a reference;
//!     consequently,
//!       it is possible (though avoidable) for objects to be modified out
//!       from underneath references.
//! Consequently,
//!   we cannot trust that an [`ObjectIndex`] is what we expect it to be when
//!   performing an operation on the graph using that index.
//!
//! To perform an operation on a particular type of object,
//!   we must first _narrow_ it.
//! Narrowing converts from the [`Object`] sum type into a more specific
//!   inner type,
//!     such as [`Ident`] or [`Expr`].
//! This operation _should_,
//!   if the compiler is operating correctly,
//!   always succeed,
//!     because the type of object should always match our expectations;
//!       the explicit narrowing is to ensure memory safety in case that
//!       assumption does not hold.
//! To facilitate this in a convenient way,
//!   operations returning an [`ObjectIndex`] will be associated with an
//!   [`ObjectKind`] that will be used to automatically perform narrowing on
//!   subsequent operations using that [`ObjectIndex`].
//!
//! Since a type mismatch represents a bug in the compiler,
//!   the API favors [`Result`]-free narrowing rather than burdening every
//!   caller with additional complexity---we
//!     will attempt to narrow and panic in the event of a failure,
//!       including a diagnostic message that helps to track down the issue
//!       using whatever [`Span`]s we have available.
//! [`ObjectIndex`] is associated with a span derived from the point of its
//!   creation to handle this diagnostic situation automatically.
