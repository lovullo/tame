//! Topological sort of [`Asg`] with ontological consideration.
//!
//! This toplogical sort is a depth-first search (DFS) that emits nodes in
//!   post-order.
//! Intuitively,
//!   it emits objects sorted in such a way that they appear before each of
//!   their dependencies.
//!
//! The ordering is deterministic between runs on the same graph,
//!   but it is only one of potentially many orderings.
//!
//! The only information provided by this sort is a stream of
//!   [`ObjectIndex`]es ordered linearly.
//! No information about the edge or source object is provided,
//!   nor is information about the length of the current path,
//!   since an object may be visited any number of different ways and the
//!   caller ought not rely on the particular path taken.
//! Furthermore,
//!   an object may be visited any number of times from any number of paths,
//!   but only the first visit is emitted,
//!     so any additional information would provide an incomplete picture;
//!       this sort is _not_ intended to provide information about all paths
//!       to a particular object and cannot be used in that way.
