/// An identifier for some object on the [`Asg`].
///
/// An identifier can be either _opaque_ declaration,
///   meaning that it stands in _place_ of a definition,

///     meaning that references to the identifier should "see through" it
///     and directly reference the object to which it is bound.
///
/// Invariants
/// ==========
/// The [`Ident`] variants represent object states:
///
/// ```text
///      ,--> ((Transparent))
///     /
/// (Missing) -> (Extern) -> ((Opaque)) -> ((IdentFragment)).
///     \                        ^                /
///      \                      / \              /
///       `--------------------`   `------------'
/// ```
///
/// The following invariants must hold with respect to [`Asg`]:
///   1. A [`Transparent`] identifier must have _one_ edge to the object
///        that it describes
///        (upheld by [`ObjectIndex::<Ident>::bind_definition`]).
///   2. All other identifiers must have _zero_ outgoing edges,
///        since they describe nothing available on the graph.
///      Since edges can only be added by
///        [`ObjectIndex::<Ident>::bind_definition`],
///          and since an [`Ident`] cannot transition away from
///            [`Transparent`],
///          this invariant is upheld.
