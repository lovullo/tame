/// Produce an iterator suitable for reconstructing a source tree based on
///   the contents of the [`Asg`].
///
/// The implementation of this traversal is exceedingly simple because of
///   its reliance on important graph invariants,
///     but it embodies a number of important and subtle properties.
///
/// Traversal Properties
/// ====================
/// This is a [depth-first search][w-depth-first-search]
///   visiting all nodes that are _reachable_ from the graph root
///     (see [`Asg::root`]).
/// [`ObjectIndex`]es are emitted in pre-order during the traversal,
///   and may be emitted more than once if
///     (a) they are the destination of cross edges or
///     (b) they are shared between trees
///           (most likely due to compiler optimizations).
///
/// The tree is defined by the graph ontology,
///   not an arbitrary graph traversal.
/// This traversal is initialized by pushing each target [`ObjectIndex`] of
///   the ASGÂ root
///     (see [`Asg::root`])
///   onto the stack.
/// Each iteration pops a single node off of the stack and visits it,
///   until no more nodes remain on the stack,
///   after which the traversal completes and the iterator is exhausted.
/// If the node was reached via a tree edge,
///   its edge targets are pushed onto the stack.
/// If a node is a target of a cross edge,
///   its edges targets are _not_ added to the stack for later traversal.
///
/// Targets of a cross edge
///   (see [`ObjectRel::is_cross_edge`])
///   will be emitted multiple times:
///
///   1. The target of a cross edge is emitted each time a cross edge is
///        followed; and
///   2. When the node is encountered on a tree edge.
///
/// The traversal relies on the ontology to enforce a tree-like structure
///   and to properly define cross edges via `ObjectRel::is_cross_edge`.
/// A _tree edge_ is an edge that is not a cross edge.
/// Consequently,
///   if a cross edge is replaced by a tree edge,
///   then this traversal interprets that edge as part of _multiple_ trees,
///     effectively inlining it as if the user had entered the exact same
///     code in both locations.
/// You should choose carefully where in the lowering pipeline you wish
///   for this traversal to take place so that the tree reconstruction has
///   the desired properties.
///
/// Because the graph is expected to be a DAG
///   (directed acyclic graph),
///     this traversal _does not track visited nodes_;
///       this ensures that nodes shared by trees due to optimizations like
///       common subexpression elimination will have proper trees
///       reconstructed.
/// If there are exceptional subgraphs where cycles do appear,
///   this traversal's implementation must be modified to take them into
///     account,
///   otherwise it will iterate indefinitely.
///
/// Edges are visited in the same order that they were added to the graph,
///   so the tree reconstruction should match closely the order of the
///   source file.
/// However,
///   note that compiler passes,
///     if present,
///     may modify the graph beyond recognition,
///       though they should retain ordering where it is important.
///
/// For more information,
///   see [`ObjectRel::is_cross_edge`].
