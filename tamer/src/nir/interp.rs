//! Interpolation parser for desugaring NIR.
//!
//! String interpolation occurs for attributes containing curly braces
//!   (`{` andÂ `}`)
//!   during TAME's parsing phase,
//!     before template expansion.
//! An attribute containing curly braces is referred to in TAME as an
//!   _interpolation specification_.
//!
//! Interpolation is used as a form of short-hand syntactic sugar for
//!   concatenation of string literals and template metavariables,
//!     whose result is then processed by the template system.
//! For example,
//!   consider the following code:
//!
//! ```xml
//!   <c:value-of name="foo{@bar@}baz" />
//! ```
//!
//! The string `foo{@bar@}baz` is the interpolation specification.
//! This ends up desugaring into the [`Nir`] equivalent of this:
//!
//! ```xml
//!   <param name="@___dsgr_01@"
//!          desc="Generated from interpolated string `foo{@bar@}baz`">
//!     <text>foo</text>
//!     <param-value name="@bar@" />
//!     <text>baz</text>
//!   </param>
//!
//!   <c:value-of name="@___dsgr_01@" />
//!   <!--              ^^^^^^^^^^^^
//!                     replacement -->
//! ```
//!
//! Since interpolation currently supports only string literals and template
//!   metavariables within specifications,
//!     they are only semantically valid within the context of a template
//!     definition.
//! This desugaring process does not check for this context;
//!   errors would occur later on in the lowering pipeline.
//!
//! Since interpolation desugars into [`Nir`],
//!   and not source XML,
//!   generated `param`s will be automatically be interpreted downstream in
//!     the lowering pipeline as if they were hoisted to the template
//!     definition header.
//!
//! If a string does not require interpolation,
//!   then it is interpreted as a literal within the context of the template
//!   system and is echoed back unchanged.
//!
//! Desugared Spans
//! ---------------
//! [`Span`]s for the generated tokens are derived from the specification
//!   string.
//! In the above example,
//!   we have:
//!
//! ```xml
//!   <!--
//!     foo{@bar@}baz
//!     [-] [---] [-]
//!      A    B    C
//!   -->
//!
//!   <text>foo</text>
//!   <!--   A     -->
//!
//!   <param-value name="@bar@">
//!   <!--       B           -->
//!
//!   <text>baz</text>
//!   <!--   C     -->
//! ```
//!
//! This means that any errors that subsequently occur due to contextual
//!   issues will be mapped back to a source location that makes sense to
//!   the user with a high level of granularity.
