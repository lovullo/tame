//! Intermediate representations for TAME programs.
//!
//! [Intermediate representations][ir] (IRs) are data structures used to
//!   represent source code in a manner most suitable for a particular phase
//!   of compilation.
//! A single IR may be used by multiple compilation phases,
//!   or by multiple systems (e.g. various compilers or [linkers][]).
//!
//! [ir]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation
//! [linkers]: crate::ld
//!
//! Each IR is responsible for raising lower-level IRs or source formats.
//!
//! Summary of IRs
//! --------------
//! Each input language begins as an [abstract syntax tree][ast]Â (AST),
//!   produced by the parser.
//! For TAME languages that are XML-based,
//!   the production of the AST is handled by [`quick_xml`],
//!     and is effectively the same as the source XML.
//!
