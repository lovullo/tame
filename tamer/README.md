TAME in Rust (TAMER)
====================
TAME was written to help tame the complexity of developing comparative
insurance rating systems.  This project aims to tame the complexity and
performance issues of TAME itself.  TAMER is therefore more tame than TAME.

TAME was originally written in XSLT.  For more information about the
project, see the [parent `README.md`](../README.md).
