Commit Messages
---------------
Tags/indicators in commit messages help to determine version number bumps.

  - Backwards-compatibility (BC) breaks must have commit subject lines
    prefixed with the string "[BC BREAK] ".

  - Feature commit subjects must be suffixed with " (feature)".

  - Bugfix commit subjects must be suffixed with " (bugfix)".


Versioning Scheme
-----------------
Use semantic versioning:

  - Backwards-incompatible changes must increment the major version number;
  - Feature additions must increment minor; and
  - Bugfixes must increment revision.

When incrementing a number, reset all that follow.
